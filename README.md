**Public Restroom Management with IoT Sensors**

## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize public restroom management by leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to monitor occupancy and maintenance needs. The primary goal is to provide real-time data on restroom availability and cleanliness to the public through a user-friendly platform or mobile app. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, components, and usage instructions.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:

- Providing real-time information on restroom availability.
- Monitoring cleanliness levels in public restrooms.
- Enhancing the overall user experience.
- Improving the efficiency of restroom management.

## Components

The project comprises the following components:

1. *IoT Sensor System Design:* This component involves planning the deployment of IoT sensors, such as occupancy sensors and cleanliness sensors, in public restrooms. These sensors collect crucial data for real-time monitoring.

2. *Real-Time Transit Information Platform:* We are developing a web-based platform and a mobile application that allows users to access real-time restroom availability and cleanliness data. Key features include user-friendly interfaces, mapping for nearby restrooms, and real-time updates.

3. *Integration Approach:* The project ensures seamless data flow from IoT sensors to the restroom information platform. Python is used for data processing and integration.

## Usage Instructions

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies for the platform and mobile app.
3. Deploy IoT sensors in public restrooms as per the sensor deployment plan.
4. Run the platform and app, ensuring they are integrated with the IoT sensors.
5. Users can access real-time restroom data through the platform and app.
